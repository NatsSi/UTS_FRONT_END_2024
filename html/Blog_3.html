          <h2 id="p1">Hatha Yoga</h2>
          <p>Hatha Yoga is often the starting point for many. It's a generic term that encompasses any form of yoga involving physical postures. Generally, Hatha classes are slower-paced, focusing on mastering the basic postures and relaxed breathing techniques. They provide an excellent introduction to the basic yoga poses, making it suitable for beginners.</p>
          
          <h2 id="p2">Vinyasa Yoga</h2>
          <p>Vinyasa, translating to "flow," is a more athletic yoga style. It focuses on the coordination of breath and movement where each posture is linked to the next in a fluid sequence. This style is diverse and varies widely depending on the instructor; however, expect to move and sweat in these sessions.</p>

          <h2 id="p3">Ashtanga Yoga</h2>
          <p>Ashtanga Yoga is a rigorous and disciplined style of yoga. It involves a precise series of poses always performed in the same order. The practice consists of six series, becoming progressively more challenging. Ashtanga is physically demanding and is excellent for building core strength and toning the body.</p>
